	   "- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost
		- Finding, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting data 
		- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure
		- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility
		- Deploying the model at scale
		- Students will complete a project culminating in deploying a computer vision and natural language processing system into production. There is also an opportunity to test your knowledge and prepare for interviews with an optional written exam."
