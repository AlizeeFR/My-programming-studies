Ordered from simple to most complex with language suggestions that I am fluent in (may change in the future with better or worse tools)

1. Scripts/tools/add-on
	<details>
		
	<summary> Automate clicks (Python or JavaScript) </summary>
		
	Rough idea
	- Use Python to allow the user to click the button he/she wants to automatically click, thus making it re-usable for many sites. 
	- Set trigger events (i.e. video finished, pop-up, etc)

	- Have Python interact with HTML/DOM

	- Possible tools: Selenium (Python)
	
	</details>
		
2. Desktop app business tools
	
	<details>
		
	<summary> Multi-window Chrome browser for language studying </summary>
				
	Have multiple windows that are collapsable/expandable/resizable etc that open up Chrome, Firefox etc  with respective add-ons.
	
	á¹”anels (all panels are expandable/collapsable)
	1. Custom dictionaries. (i.e. double click on a word in a chrome tab with specified key --> window-popup with translation. Include API queries from Reverso Context, Linguee, etc.
		
	1. CEFR vocabulary/grammatical item explanations and position in frequency list  + mnemonic. Include CEFR objectives.
		
	1. Conjugation chart panel/reference sheet
		
	1. Custom feed aggregator from news sites to open up in Chrome/Firefox window etc
		
	1. In-house video playlist collection with offline download support for specific cultural topics (country-specific history for said language (I.e. Spanish is spoken in South America, Central America, Puerto Rico, Spain, Canary Islands etc), civics, art/music, laws, mythology, the name of the best-selling author writing in said language for specifies genres, Kindle Unlimited/Scribd/traditional press), plus free MOOCs or tv episodes published online. Automatically grab subtitles from source & allow in-app streaming like VLC media player) to allow dual subtitles. There should be an option to randomly refresh for new material or factoids.
				
				
	Touch-ups:
	- Have panel that connects to smartphone for remote control/using android or iphone apps on the computer app. 
	- Use network tools to grab media stream source/automatic login using a robot
	- Reference sheet of exams to prove one's skills + an estimator of one's current level using said exam (CEFR vs ACTFL, ILS, etc) and record the approximate time it took to reach such a level and what you could use such skills for in real life (I.e. study abroad/foreign student, work abroad, practice medicine/other professions, naturalize for citizenship, work as a translator) and where such skills can be used or are in demand (i.e. intelligence agencies, state departments, diplomatic agencies, scanning job markets and linkedIN pages for multi-lingual job ads or companies who aren't openly advertising but whose businesses focus on global markets).
