# My-programming-studies

***Disclaimer: this is just a plan of my future resum√©. I am building/changing this as it goes along and am only at year 1. I'm beginning college soon. This repository is being used to practice merges, commits, command-line connections and so on while organizing my academic studies.***

Years studied to gain the below skills and construct projects: 5 to 8 years (bachelors + 7-year medical school + 1 year for any accelerated degrees (4+1), 40 to 60 hours a week of studying official college courses + the ones here. Use Focuster.com, SquareUp, and Gantt Project Management plans for students like Asana to track progess & collaboration)

Technical skills to study:

- Familiarity with natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (udacity nanodegrees & __java books)
- Familiarity with data visualization, analysis, and business training in project management, marketing, and business administration (udacity nanodegrees, study.com while in college, work with venture capitalist & the funders for the startup to develop business plan & marketing plan & use Tableau from business analaytics etc nanodegree for data-based marketing)
- Familiarity with software design paradigms (Agile, Scrum framework, Project+ and preparing for PMP) - PluralSight
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces and vesrion control with Git
- DevOps background in networking and cloud computing and AWS (**CompTIA A+**, Network+ (next), Cloud Essentials, Security+, Project+, IT Operations Specialist, ITIL Foundations, LPI Linux Essentials, CCNA, CCNA Security, CCDA and CCENT) - PluralSight & Udacity Nanodegreee w/ focus on CI/CD pipline, Kubernetes, Docker, & AWS through Pluralsight & udacity nanodegree training
