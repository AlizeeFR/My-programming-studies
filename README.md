# My-programming-studies

***Disclaimer: this is just a plan of my future resum√©. Freshman, fall 2020. This repository is being used to practice merges, commits, command-line connections and so on while organizing my academic studies.***

Years studied to gain the below skills and construct projects: 5 to 8 years (bachelors + 7-year medical school + 1 year for any accelerated degrees (4+1), 40 to 60 hours a week of studying official college courses + the ones here. Use Focuster.com, SquareUp, and Gantt Project Management plans for students like Asana to track progess & collaboration)

Technical skills to study:

- Familiarity with natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (udacity nanodegrees & __java books)
- Familiarity with data visualization, analysis, and business training in project management, marketing, and business administration (udacity nanodegrees, study.com while in college, work with venture capitalist & the funders for the startup to develop business plan & marketing plan & use Tableau from business analaytics etc nanodegree for data-based marketing)
- Familiarity with software design paradigms (Agile, Scrum framework, Project+ and preparing for PMP) - PluralSight
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces and vesrion control with Git
- DevOps background in networking and cloud computing and AWS (**CompTIA A+**, Network+ (next), Cloud Essentials, Security+, Project+, IT Operations Specialist, ITIL Foundations, LPI Linux Essentials, CCNA, CCNA Security, CCDA and CCENT) - PluralSight & Udacity Nanodegreee w/ focus on CI/CD pipline, Kubernetes, Docker, & AWS through Pluralsight & udacity nanodegree training
- Database administration and SQL


Languages and applications for such languages (in order of proficiency)
 - Java SE
   * NLP, AI, ML
   * Android development
   * Desktop applications
 - Python
   * Automation and scripting, data visualization and analysis
   * Data Science and Data Visualization
   * Data extraction from Excel, SQL Databases, SAS, and the web 
   * Machine learning and deep learning
 - JavaScript, jQuery, and node.js
 - HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
 - PHP, MongoDB, Ruby on Rails
 
 **For Current Studies (non-data structure/algorithm oriented), see __java.md and __udacity.md**
 
 Done with algs & data structs. Now doing project on Python for web automation and trying to execute it as a script to make my studies easier.
 
 
 Eventual graduation:
    Dual degree: Biomedical Sciences (BSc) and Computer Science (BS.CS)
  
  Graduate degrees:
    MD Medical Degree (guaranteed BS-MD program): 3 years (1st year counts towards undergrad final year)
    MSc Computer Science (accelerated BS-MsC): 1 year
    MSc in Biomedical engineering, focus in Pharmaceutical nanoengineering (co-admit to the MD program with MCAT scores, bring in half credits from MD program)
